# Database Connection Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing database connection failures with the error:
```
web-1   | Database connection failure: could not translate host name "db" to address: Name or service not known
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because:
1. The Docker Compose configuration was missing
2. No database service named "db" was defined
3. The web service couldn't resolve the hostname "db" to an IP address

## Solution
Created a complete Docker Compose setup with:

### 1. docker-compose.yml
- Defined two services: `web` (Odoo) and `db` (PostgreSQL)
- Configured `web` service to depend on `db` service
- Set up proper service networking (both on default Docker network)
- Configured environment variables for database connection

### 2. config/odoo.conf
- Set `db_host = db` to point to the PostgreSQL service
- Configured database credentials (user: odoo, password: odoo)
- Set up addons path for custom modules

### 3. Service Configuration
The key fixes in docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: odoo:17.0
    depends_on:
      - db          # Ensures db starts first
    environment:
      - HOST=db     # Points to db service
      - USER=odoo
      - PASSWORD=odoo
      
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=odoo
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=odoo
```

## How It Works
1. Docker Compose creates a default network for all services
2. Services can reach each other using service names as hostnames
3. The `db` service name becomes a resolvable hostname within the network
4. The `web` service can now successfully connect to `db:5432`

## Verification
Run the validation script to verify the fix:
```bash
./validate.sh
```

All checks should pass:
- ✓ docker-compose.yml syntax is valid
- ✓ Required services (web, db) are defined
- ✓ Web service has dependencies configured
- ✓ Required directories exist
- ✓ Odoo configuration file exists
- ✓ Database host is correctly set to 'db'

## Testing
To start the services and verify the fix:
```bash
# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Check services are running
docker compose ps

# View logs to confirm no connection errors
docker compose logs web

# Access Odoo at http://localhost:8069
```

You should no longer see the "could not translate host name 'db'" error.
